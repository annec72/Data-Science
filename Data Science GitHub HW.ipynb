    "1. Name one purpose for github: GitHub is a platform that is useful for multiple reasons. One important purpose is that it allows you to collaborate with other people and share information/code.\n",
    "2. Describe what is version control in your own words and how it could help you in your project: Version control is essentially a way to track changes that you make while you are working on a project. For example, if you am working on a project and somehow a chunk of code gets complely deleted, GitHub saves all changes, so you can go back to what you previously had before your code got deleted.\n",
    "3. Explain how in a group project (which we are not doing) github could help manage collaboration: For a group project, GitHub could be useful for collaboration because it has track changes. It will keep track of which person edited a notebook, what they edited, and how much they added or deleted. This would be useful in keeping track of if people were actually contributing or doing their assigned work.\n",
    "4. Describe why employers might be interested in looking at a candidate's github sitr: An employer may be interested in looking at a candidates stir to see their work and how well they work. By that, looking at one's stir will allow an employer to see what practical skills a candidate has and if they're effecient. They can review their code for accuracy/ complexity, as well as view their history to see how they move forward with thier work or how they contribute to a project."
