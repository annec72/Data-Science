    "This research paper is about Proliferative Kidney Disease (PKD) which is  disease that affects salmonid fish and can result in high mortality rates in salmonid fish species. The goal of this paper was to determine if there was a correlation between water temperature (caused by global warming) and the prevalance/severity of PKD (caused by the parasite T. bryosalmonae) in wild salmonid (brown trout) populations. With this, the researchers goal was to perform measurments on these fish, and gain insight into host physiology in a natural envionment, to aviod biases that are found\n",

    "a)\tDescribe the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "    i.\tFor this set of data, the authors sampled juvenile anadromous brown trout from the wild. They assessed each trout’s parasite load using  DNA quantification and qPCR. Following that, they gained insight into each fish by conducting both performance experiments (respiratory measurements, temperature tolerance, etc.) and tissue collection/analysis (blood hematocrit, leukocyte counts, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    ii.\tThere were a total of 36 features from this data set. These include basic info like the month fish were collected, river of origin, weight, length, mass, different types of white blood cell counts, concentrations of those leukocyte counts, standard metabolic rate trials (SMR) (3 per fish), maximum metabolic rate trials (MMR) (3 per fish), the means of both SMR and MMR, standard deviations (SD) as well as upper thermal tolerance UTT) trials and the conditions of the tank/water in each trial. Each feature specifically describes a certain characteristic about each fish (each observation). \n",
    "\n",
    "    iii.\tThere are 104  observations in this data set each observation referring to an individual fish being studied. One observation indicates one wild type fish that was caught from a 1 of 2 rivers during the months of July or September, and subsequently underwent performative testing and tissue sampling An example of a few fish observations include the fish IDs like, Fish 1, Fish 3, Fish 6, etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "b)\tDescribe how the data relates to the research question the authors were asking, and one other research question that you could ask\n",
    "\n",
    "    i)\tThe authors of this paper explored the topic of Proliferative Kidney Disease (PKD) which is  disease that affects salmonid fish and can result in high mortality rates in salmonid fish species. The basis of this paper is that the interactions between a host fish and a parasite have been studied in controlled laboratory conditions, but it is also important to study this interaction in a natural environment in the context of global warming. Here, the researchers wanted to investigate/ aim to characterize the effect of T. bryosalmonae infection on the performance of wild brown trout to and to see if increased parasite burdens from PKD show a correlation with the severity of the symptoms. \n",
    "\n",
    "    ii)    One other question that could be asked is if the river of origin/ population  have an effect on leukocyte counts? These populations may or may not have more gene flow compared to the other, allowing for variation, therefore different populations may or may not be better suited for defending off pathogens. This data is useful for this purpose as each river tested is associated with a particular fish as well as the different counts for each leukocyte tested, providing the data needed to answer this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Section 2: Describe the data files you downloaded. You can open them in Excel or look at them in Jupyter too if you want. For each file:\n",
    " There are 2 data files to download for the data on this paper. One file contains all the observations and measurements and is available as a .fsv and the other is a .txt.\n",
    " \n",
    "a)\t\n",
    "\n",
    "    i.\tFile 1 is the .fsv file and technically has 105 rows (observations), and 37 columns (features) but one row and column is taken by the column headings, so it is 104 x 36. It is essentially the main file that can be downloaded as an excel file and shows the observations as the rows, and the features as columns with numerical data in each cell. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    ii.\tThe data in this field is displayed as a normal data table. Delimiters for this data mainly use the dash ( - ), and quotations ( “ ” ), and period ( . ) to show decimal values.\n",
    "\n",
    "b)   \n",
    "    \n",
    "    i.\tThe .txt file gives a list of each of the features, and a description of how they were obtained. It also states if each feature is a “primary” or “derived” piece of data. Primary data indicates info was from the original testing, like tissue data and performance data (leukocyte counts, metabolic rates, etc. ). On the other hand, the derived data indicates data that came from the primary data, where something had to be done with the primary data to obtain derived data (leukocyte averages, concentrations, qPCR results, etc).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ii.\tThe .txt file’s data is also just simply displayed as a list. Delimiters for this list include the use of a dash (-), parentheses ( ), colon ( : ), period ( . ), quotation marks (“”), an asterisk ( * ), and a degree sign ( ° ). \n",

    "\n",
    " \n",
    "a)\t\n",
    "    \n",
    "    i.\tThe data in the plot shows kidney hyperplasia (Kidney/body thickness)  on the y- axis, vs the relative parasite load on the x-axis. K/B ratio was generated by producing a cross section of the fish body to observe the size of the kidney in relation to the body. Parasite load was established through DNA quantification with qPCR (amplification of parasite DNA).  Triangles represent July sampling, circles represent September sampling light gray represents Vainupea (river pop) individuals, and dark gray represents Musoja(river pop) individual fish tested. \n",
    "\n",
    "    ii.\tThis figure was part of a panel that visually showed the side difference of the fish body to kidney size ratio, and this figure shows the actual data correlated with the picture, which is why it was important to the authors to include.\n",
    "\n",
    "    iii.\tBased on the plot, it looks like fish with a lower parasite burden have smaller more normal sized kidneys, while an increase in parasite DNA led to an increase in kidney size.  \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "    i.\tThe figure above shows the body mass generated from the mass feature and the standard metabolic rate feature, and it specifically distinguishes the river population of each fish tested. On the x-axis is the body mass of each fish tested, and the Standard Metabolic Rate (SMR) of each fish on the y-axis. Triangles represent July sampling, circles represent September sampling light gray represents Vainupea (river pop) individuals, and dark gray represents Musoja (river pop)  individual fish tested. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    ii.\tThis figure is part of a bigger panel of figures that all focus on the SMR. The panel shows SMR as the y- axis for all figure and the x-axis is what changes. This figure was necessary and was displayed because it showed if there is a correlation between fish mass and its metabolic rate.  SMR is a feature that was designed to be compared to metabolic rates after fish were infected to see if there was a change. \n",
    "    iii.\tFrom this figure, it looks like in general, fish that are between 1 and  2.5 g have a similar standard metabolic rate compared to fish outside of that range.\n",
    "    \n",
    "b)\tBased on the figure just mentioned, I would maybe make a data table associated with just the information found on the graph to simplify the information. The observations would still be each fish tested, but the features would be narrowed down to K/B ratio and parasite \n",

    "Section 1:\n",
    "aii - What are the features? How many, and what do they tell us about the observation?: The error I made was that, I listed the features based on what was tested from the host fish, but didn't include information about the parasite, but mentioned the parasite in the next section. The features of this dataset are solely collected from the host fish and there are no feature from just the parasite. However, I could have done a better job explaining that some of the features obtained from the host fish, were obtained BECAUSE the fish was infected with parasites. For example, one imporatnt feature that I failed to mention was the the kidney/body ratio (KB ratio) which was measured after the fish was infected. Similarly, the kidney depth of the fish was measured as a feature and that was obtained after infection.\n",
    "\n",
    "bi: Describe the research question the authors were asking and why they used this data to answer that research question. This section I was a bit unclear where I didn't explain where the infection part came in as well as I could have/ I said that the researchers wanted to characterize the effects of infection. Instead, the goal of this paper was to see if there was a correlation in increased water temp (caused by global warming), and the prevalance/severity of PKD (caused by the parasite). So they were not actually directly looking at the parasite, but some of the effects it had on its host.\n",
    "\n",
    "Section 3: Fig 1i: I was mostly clear on the figure I chose, but could have clarified a bit more on teh figure in terms of where my feature of kidney hyperplasia was derived from. I said that one of the axes (y-axis) is kidney hyperplasia or (Kidney/body ratio- KB ratio), and that the KB ratio was measured by looking at the cross section of the body, and measuring the size of the kidney and body. The question/ thing i needed to fix was if kidney hyperplasia derived from what I described in the features section. Based on my original submission, I never mentioned KB ratio in my features, so that is where I messed up, as KB ratio is and shoud've been mentioned in the feature section, and was derived from teh features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2ii:\n",
    "For this section, I essentially showed a data plot that didn't really support the hypothesis/it just wasn't very relevant. The plot essentially described if a fish's mass affected its standard metabolic rate. Overall, the SMR and mass does not have significant relevance o the hypothesis or goal of the study. A better plot to have picked would be the one where the y-axis is hematocrit levels, and the x- axis has the K/B ratio. Essentially, the plot has 3, 2 dashed ones, and 1 line of best fit, showing a downward trend of hematocrit as the K/B ration increases. The authors chose to include this figure to show if there is a decrease in the amount of red blood cells in the body of the host with infection/ if infection has an impact on this level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fig 2iii: My mistake here was that I interpreted the relationship incorrectly on the plot. I was kind of just looking at where most of the dots clustered, but I should have actually looked at the line of best fit and explained where that line seemed to trend. The correct interpretation should be that standard metabolic rate increases as the mass of fish increases. This makes sense as a bigger fish will require an increased metabolic rate. For the plot I should have chosen, the line of best fit shows a significant downward trend. Essentially, hematocrit decreases as K/B ratio increases. An increased K/B ratio indicates that the kidney is bigger than usual, and is inflamed suggesting it is caused by infection, and the decreased red blood cells corroborates this, as decrease hematocrit is known to occur during parasite infections.\n",
    "\n",
    "3b: Lastly, I was trying to make a smaller table to describe the K/B ratio and the qPCR results. My aim was to see if each fish had both an increased K/B ratio, and increased qPCR measurement(qPCR was done to quantify parasite DNA) to kind of show that the increased parasite load correlated with the K/B ratio going up. Looking at it, it is essentially like the plot I described for Fig 1i. I should have probably just explained another plot that may be useful to make for this data. Looking at the data, I think that making a bar plot that conveys the mean thermal tolerance (y-axis) of all infected vs all uninfected fish at different water temperatures (x-axis) may prove useful. This would demonstrate how infection worsens as the water temp increases.\n",

    "The shape command tells us that there are, 104 rows, and 37 columns, and looking at the date table, we now we have an extra column at the end 'Unnamed: 37', which we do not want. To fix that, I needed to change the amount of columns we want to actually work with, using .iloc. So, I took the data frame, and made it so we only see relevant columns, which should be 36."

    "Interpretation: Looking at the plot above, as expected there are many more observations that fall into the bin closest to the mean (0.29), which is about 28/29 fish. This makes sense, becuase when we used the .describe () feature earlier it said the minimum [ ] would be 0.03, and the max would be 0.39, which makes sense based on the calculated minimum and maximum. It is important to look at haematocrit levels, as it has to do with red blood cells, and thus the oxygen-carrying capacity. This can be affected in instances of PKD (giving us an idea of the relation between PKD severity and physical performance) "

    "Interpretation: Based on the plot above, the K/B ratio seems to somewhat increase, or shows tha theres some kind of trend along with the qPCR_ddCt (parasite expression levels) also increasing. If both are increasing, this suggests maybe some type of correation between the two. This would kind of make sense as a bigger KB ratio indicates that there is some issue with the kidney such as inflammation or damage, while the increase of parasite DNA expression would be indicative of a larger parasite burden. Essentially, damage or inflammation increases when there are more parasites. One thing to mention though is that the mean KB ratio is around 0.3, and the observations don't really seem to be clustering there. However this could also tell us that the KB ratio does increase eventually then. The K/B ratio is relavant as one of the hypotheses is that an increased K/B ratio serves as a driving factor of decreased thermal tolerance in brown trout. "
